## Motivation

According to research:

> - 78% of women in tech reports that they feel they have to work harder than their male coworkers to prove their worth. 
> - Women in tech are four times more likely than men to see gender bias as an obstacle to promotion.
> - 66% of women in tech felt excluded from key social and network opportunities due to gender

Being a woman/girl in tech is never easy and just to make things a bit easier for all the amazing women and girls in tech we are centralizing all the events and opportunities for women in tech in one place so no one would ever miss out any opportunity and can access all of those information with ease.
